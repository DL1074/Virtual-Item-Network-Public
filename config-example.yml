# VHN - Virtual Hopper Networks Configuration
# This is an example configuration file for the public repository
# Copy this to your server's plugins/VHN/config.yml and customize as needed

# Performance Settings
performance:
  # Enable/disable the plugin
  enabled: true
  
  # Maximum number of hoppers in a single network
  max-network-size: 50
  
  # Minimum number of hoppers to form a network
  min-network-size: 2
  
  # Maximum items to transfer per operation
  max-transfer-amount: 8
  
  # Speed multiplier for transfers (1.0 = vanilla speed)
  # Ultra-low for 50k+ networks to prevent lag
  transfer-speed-multiplier: 1.0
  
  # How often to process networks (in ticks)
  # Process every 20 ticks (1 second) for better performance
  process-interval: 20
  
  # Batch processing: how many networks to process per tick
  # Networks are rotated so all get processed over multiple ticks
  # Set to -1 to process all networks every interval (legacy behavior)
  # Recommended: 25-50 for 50-100 networks (processes all networks over 2-4 ticks)
  max-networks-per-tick: 50

# Network Detection
network:
  # Auto-detect networks when chunks load
  auto-detect-on-load: false
  
  # Auto-scan when players join (scans their loaded chunks)
  auto-scan-on-join: true
  
  # Rebuild networks when hoppers are placed/broken
  auto-rebuild: true
  
  # Maximum distance to scan for connected hoppers (in blocks)
  scan-radius: 128
  
  # Include hopper minecarts in networks (experimental)
  include-minecarts: false
  
  # How often to cleanup networks in unloaded chunks (in minutes)
  cleanup-interval: 10

# World Settings
worlds:
  # Worlds where VHN is disabled
  disabled-worlds:
    - world_nether_disabled_example
    - world_the_end_disabled_example

# Debug Settings
debug:
  # Enable debug logging (verbose output)
  enabled: false
  
  # Log network creation/destruction
  log-network-changes: false
  
  # Log item transfers
  log-transfers: false

# Recommended Settings by Server Size:
#
# Small Server (2-10 networks):
#   process-interval: 20
#   max-transfer-amount: 8
#   max-networks-per-tick: -1
#
# Medium Server (50-100 networks):
#   process-interval: 20
#   max-transfer-amount: 8
#   max-networks-per-tick: 25
#
# Large Server (100+ networks):
#   process-interval: 20
#   max-transfer-amount: 8
#   max-networks-per-tick: 50
